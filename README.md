# League of Legends Player Analyzer


Riot’s League of Legends is a massive online multiplayer game with recent figures showing an active player base of over 80 million monthly players. With this massive player base comes a ton of data. 

Our aim is to harness this data to develop a product that can help League of Legends enthusiasts improve. League of Legends Player Analyzer allows users to search for specific top ranked challenger players from any region. 

Users are provided statistics such as the player’s win rate, number of matches played, most played champions, and their entire match history. 
Regional data is also displayed - this consists of the top ten players by win rate, as well as players who played a specific role and position the most often. 

Lastly, a Wiki is also available. It consists of champions, items, runes, and summoner spells information. From the champions “wiki” page, a user can select one of the champions to view the top ten players for that specific champion.
